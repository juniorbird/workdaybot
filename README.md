# workdaybot

Workdaybot is a Slack bot who helps you through your workday.

## Current Status

Workdaybot uses oAuth to authorize with Slack on your behalf. Workdaybot will then open a websockets connection to Slack, and connect to your slack team. Unfortunately, that's all it does right now. It's kind of a nice oAuth demo, if you want to step through it.

If you'd like an even nicer oAuth demo, check out the [SVG-powered demo I built](http://juniorbird.github.io/oauth-explainer/) using what I learned from this project.

## About Keys & Security

The keys and secrets used in this library have been deactivated. You'll have to mint your own.
